Menu is a menu making app for use with phpWebsite.  The goal is to have an simple way to create an embedded menu.  Tags 
are used to identify menus and items.  Menus and items can be added to menus using the tags.
Example:

     $menu = new Menu('top_level', 'Menu');
     $menu->addMenu('search', 'Search');
     $menu->addMenuItem('name_search', 'Search Names', 'search');
     $menu->addMenuItem('email_search', 'Search Emails', 'search');
     $menu->addMenu('settings', 'Settings');
     $menu->addMenu('email_settings', 'Email Settings', 'setttings');

From the example you can see that the menu has gone three menus deep. It can go further but I don't wanna right now.
